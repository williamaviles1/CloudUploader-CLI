<h1>Cloud Uploader CLI</h1>


## Introduction

Hi! Welcome to my project. This project comes from the [Learn to Cloud Guide](https://learntocloud.guide/phase1/#capstone-project-clouduploader-cli), a structured and carefully put together guide on building skills suited for cloud engineering. I really enjoyed the process of this project because not only did it deal with AWS but it was also through PowerShell, which I have been excited to work in. As I continue my career, I have been curious to learn new things and advance my career as an IT professional. Down below I’ll guide you through the project for you to follow along.



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell: Primary scripting language used to create the CLI tool.</b> 
- <b>AWS CLI: Used to interact with AWS S3 for file uploads.</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (22H2)

## Project Overview

Initially, this project was intended to be run through the bash CLI but I was more interested in creating it as a powershell script. The powershell script will upload a file(s) to a cloud storage from the CLI. Since I am familiar with AWS services and want to gain scripting experience, it seemed like a great idea to bridge both technologies to further enhance my learning.

### Step 1: Setting up AWS
Before jumping into building the script, start by setting up the AWS services needed for the script to function properly. Below you’ll find the services used:
Service

|Service    |Description    |
|:----------|:----------|
|IAM|Identity and Access Management – helps securely control access to AWS resources by managing users, groups, and permissions|
|S3|Simple Storage Solution – scalable storage that lets you store and retrieve data from the web |
