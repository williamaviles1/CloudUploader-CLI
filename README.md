<h1>Cloud Uploader CLI</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
Hi! Welcome to my project. This project comes from the [Learn to Cloud Guide](https://learntocloud.guide/phase1/#capstone-project-clouduploader-cli), a structured and carefully put together guide on building skills suited for cloud engineering. I really enjoyed the process of this project because not only did it deal with AWS but it was also through powershell which I have been excited to work in. As I continue my career I have been curious to learn new things and advance my career as an IT professional. Down below Iâ€™ll guide you through the project for you to follow along.
